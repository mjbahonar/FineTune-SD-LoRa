Prepare the Dataset\n","In this guide, we will fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model using LoRA with the **[Pokémon dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/svjack/pokemon-blip-captions-en-zh)** from Hugging Face. This dataset can be easily replaced with another dataset.\n","\n","If you are creating your **own dataset**, you can prepare a CSV file named `metadata.csv`. The first column should contain `file_name`, and the second column should contain corresponding text captions. [[1](https://machinelearningmastery.com/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-with-lora/)]\n","\n","### 2. Set Up the Environment\n","Next, install the required libraries, including `diffusers`, `accelerate`, and `wandb`. [[1]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-with-lora/). The main script used for this purpose can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/diffusers/main/examples/text_to_image/train_text_to_image_lora.py).\n","\n","### 3. Run the Training Script\n","Use the `accelerate launch` command with the training script, specifying the dataset, model, and hyperparameters. A detailed explanation of each parameter can be found [here](https://learnopencv.com/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-3-5m/).\n","\n","### 4. Training Process\n","The training process can take several hours, even with a high-end GPU.\n","\n","### 5. Using Your Trained LoRA Model\n","After training, you will have a small weight file, typically named `pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors`. You can use it by loading it into a Stable Diffusion pipeline with:\n","`pipe.unet.load_attn_procs(model_path)`\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":132177,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739180161818,"user":{"displayName":"Mohammad
